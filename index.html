                <p>In November 2018, a papercut project was deployed that implemented a new 45-minute meal break configuration to NY associates using the “US FC NY Amazon Associate” payrule. This enabled 1,800 out of the then 2,800 eligible associates to take 45-minute meal breaks without UPT miscalculations. The remaining eligible population is still configured to only accommodate 30-minute meal breaks. Because of this, night shift associates who take 45-minute meal breaks are being charged one hour of UPT for every shift worked. Impacted sites must submit daily tickets to ERC to resolve the incorrect UPT deductions which results in approximately 30 seconds of labor per associate per day. This issue also creates a poor experience for associates who are receiving daily deductions to their UPT balance for taking their mandatory breaks. Many sites with eligible employees were not aware of the NY law regarding night shift employees prior to this project and are still not compliant with the law</p>
